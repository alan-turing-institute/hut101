## What is hut101?

hut101 is a Research Engineering Group (REG) project aimed at helping university students take their first steps into open-source software contributions by taking on clearly scoped tasks with the support of a REG coach.

All the available tasks are currently listed on a GitHub project board, which can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/319/views/1).

## Objectives

Collectively, we aim to improve the skill level, diversity, and public perception of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) profession. This is achieved through the following sub-goals:

- To provide a welcoming and guided environment where participants can learn to contribute to open-source software, thus improving their ability to develop software in a collaborative manner.
- To lower barriers for participation of women & other underrepresented groups in software engineering through targeted outreach. For these groups, open-source software development can be even more intimidating than usual.
- To promote awareness of the RSE profession amongst participants.
- To foster external contributions to the open-source projects that REG and the Turing work on.

## What is the process?

- If you are a student and want to participate: [For students](./students)
- If you are a member of REG wanting to coach: [For REG members](./reg)
