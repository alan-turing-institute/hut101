This page details information for students wanting to participate in hut101.

## The process

1. **Find a project**

   A list of potential projects are available on the [hut101 project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/319). You can browse through these to find a project to work on.

   The projects are labelled with difficulty levels, so you can choose one that matches your experience and available time. [Here is a quick guide to choosing a difficulty level](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1vPE26eq55vU-WD9zXz7MGyht3CFbjbwILr2Pww5PdDo/edit); but you're more than welcome to reach out if you would like some help deciding!

2. **Sign up for it**

   Sign up to work on a project by commenting on the corresponding GitHub issue. The coach will aim to get in touch within the next 2 weeks to set up an initial call. 

3. **Set expectations**

   In the call, you and the REG coach will establish the background, level of support needed, agree on timescale and contact hours. This will vary depending on the project itself but won't be more than a few hours throughout the course of the project.

4. **Write code!**

   You should then begin working on the code in your own time. This should be done by forking the existing repository, creating a branch for your work, pushing your changes to GitHub and creating a draft PR on the original repository. Your REG coach can review your code as needed throughout this process. 

5. **Code review**

   When the PR is ready, change the PR from draft to ready to review. Contact your coach to let them know you've done this. Your PR will be formally reviewed, either by the coach or by someone else on the project. Note that fixing issues based on feedback may take a substantial amount of time so this should be incorporated into the expected timescale!

6. **Address feedback**

   Once all fixes or suggested changes have been addressed, your PR will be merged (hopefully).

7. **Celebrate!**

   You and your coach may then have a follow up call to review and evaluate the process. This also gives you an opportunity to let us know how you found the experience and provide feedback.
